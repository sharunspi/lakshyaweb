          <p>Paintball is a game in which players compete, in teams or individually, to eliminate opponents
by tagging them with capsules containing water soluble dye and gelatin shell outside (referred to
as paintballs) propelled from a device called a paintball marker (commonly referred to as a
paintball gun).</p></br>

1.) Masks on: Within any given area of the paintball field, either all players/officials/spectators
masks must be on, or all players markers must either have a barrel block in place or be
disconnected from their gas source, to ensure that a paintball cannot be fired from any nearby
marker and cause eye injury.
</br>
2.) Minimum Distance: A minimum distance rule; such as 15 feet (4.5 m), whereby players
cannot shoot an opponent if they are closer than this distance.
</br>
3.) Hit: A player is hit if a paintball leaves a solid, quarter-sized mark anywhere on the player’s
body or equipment
</br>
4.) Overshooting: We discourage players from overshooting (also regarded as bonus balling,
“overkill” or lighting up), which is to repeatedly shoot a player after they are eliminated from the
game. It is also considered overshooting if a player knew the opponent was eliminated but
continued to shoot, disregarding the safety of the opposing player and risking dangerous injury
to others.
</br>
5.) Ramping: Ramping is a feature of many electronic markers, where after a certain number of
rapid shots or upon a threshold rate-of- fire being achieved by the player, the gun will begin firing
faster than the trigger is being pulled. Ramping of rate of fire is prohibited.
</br>
6.) Wiping: Players may attempt to cheat by wiping paint from themselves, to pretend they were
not hit and stay in the game. If caught, “wipers” are generally called out of the game
</br>
7.) Non-contact: Players are generally prohibited from physically contacting other players, such
as colliding with them, physically restraining them, and especially using fists, feet, protective
gear or the markers themselves to hit other players.
</br>
8.) All equipments will be provided by the programme volunteers</p>  </div>
